# What Is Work In Process (WIP)

## Core Definition
**Work In Process (WIP)** represents unfinished construction projects that span multiple accounting periods and exist in varying stages of completion. It is a financial and operational measurement system used to track performance while jobs are "in flight," rather than waiting for project completion.

## Primary Purpose
*   **Performance Visibility:** Provides insight into project status before completion.
*   **Early Warning System:** Identifies margin erosion, cost overruns, billing misalignment, and cash flow risks.
*   **Operational Bridge:** Connects field-level reality (Operations) with financial reporting (Finance).

## Methodology: Percent Complete
WIP typically uses the **Percent Complete** method to measure progress.

### Inputs
1.  **Costs Incurred:** Actual spend to date (Labor, Materials, Direct Costs).
2.  **Total Estimated Costs:** The current best estimate of the final cost to build the project.
3.  **Estimated Cost to Complete (CTC):** The remaining cost needed to finish the job.

### Calculation Logic
$$ \text{Percent Complete} = \frac{\text{Total Costs To Date}}{\text{Total Estimated Costs}} $$

### Outputs
*   **Progress Percentage:** How far along the physical work is assumed to be.
*   **Earned Revenue:** The amount of revenue that should be recognized based on progress.
*   **Expected Profitability:** The projected margin at the current point in time.

## Nature of Data
*   **Dynamic Measurement:** WIP is **not** a static record of historical fact (like a bank statement).
*   **Estimation-Based:** It relies on assumptions, disciplined cost tracking, and realistic estimates.
*   **Forward-Looking:** It projects future outcomes based on current trajectories.

## Critical Distinctions
*   **WIP vs. Cash:** WIP measures *value created* and *obligations incurred*, not cash in the bank.
*   **WIP vs. Billings:** WIP measures *earned revenue*, which may differ from what has been invoiced (see Over/Underbilling).

## Strategic Value
WIP solves the problem of **"how to understand job performance before it’s too late to fix it."** It allows leadership to take corrective action on active jobs to protect margins and cash flow.
