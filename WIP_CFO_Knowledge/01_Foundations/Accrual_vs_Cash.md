# Cash vs. Accrual Accounting: Why It Matters to WIP

Understanding the distinction between Cash and Accrual accounting is essential because WIP only functions within an **accrual-based** view of the business.

## 1. Cash Accounting: "What Actually Moved?"
*   **Definition:** Records activity only when money changes hands.
    *   Revenue = Cash Received.
    *   Expenses = Bills Paid.
*   **Primary Question:** "What hit the bank?"
*   **Pros:** Intuitive; aligns with day-to-day reality (payroll, vendor checks). Measures short-term survival (liquidity).
*   **Limitation:** **Says nothing about job performance.** Large deposits or delayed billings can mask true profitability. A losing job can look profitable if cash is front-loaded.

## 2. Accrual Accounting: "What Was Earned?"
*   **Definition:** Recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of cash movement.
*   **Primary Question:** "What actually happened economically?"
*   **Role in Construction:** The only way to measure performance over time. Matches costs to the period work was performed.
*   **Connection:** This is where **WIP** lives.

## 3. WIP as the Bridge
WIP bridges the gap because cash and accrual rarely align due to billing lags and project duration. It uses estimates to translate **operational progress** into **accrual-based financials**.

### Key Questions Answered by WIP
1.  How much work has actually been completed?
2.  How much revenue should be recognized to date?
3.  Are we ahead of or behind our billings?
4.  Are margins holding or eroding while the job is active?

### Common Scenarios Revealed
*   **Cash strong, Accrual weak:** Margins are deteriorating, but cash flow hasn't caught up yet.
*   **Cash tight, Accrual strong:** Jobs are performing well, but collections are lagging.
*   **Overbilling:** Temporarily props up cash, hiding potential losses.
*   **Underbilling:** Hides real profitability by delaying revenue recognition.

## 4. Why the Distinction Matters
Neither method tells the full story alone.
*   **Cash** tells you if you can meet obligations (Solvency).
*   **Accrual (via WIP)** tells you if you are making money (Profitability).

**Strategic Insight:** WIP exposes the *gap* between the two. It clarifies whether a mismatch between cash and profit is a **timing issue** or a **real risk** (operational or financial), allowing leaders to act while there is time to respond.
