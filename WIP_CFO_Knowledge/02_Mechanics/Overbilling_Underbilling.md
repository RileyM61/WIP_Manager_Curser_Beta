# Overbilling vs. Underbilling: The Cash Flow Truth Inside WIP

Overbilling and underbilling explain why a company can be “profitable” and still feel broke—or why cash can look strong while margins quietly collapse.

## 1. Core Definitions
WIP compares **earned revenue** (what you should recognize based on progress) to **billings** (what you invoiced).

- **Overbilling**: Billings > Earned Revenue  
  You have invoiced ahead of progress.
- **Underbilling**: Earned Revenue > Billings  
  You have performed work that you have not yet billed for.

## 2. The Calculation (Conceptually)
1. **Percent Complete** = Costs to Date ÷ Estimated Total Cost
2. **Earned Revenue** = Contract Value × Percent Complete
3. **Billing Position** = Billings to Date − Earned Revenue

Interpretation:
- Positive Billing Position = **Overbilling**
- Negative Billing Position = **Underbilling**

## 3. Where It Lives Financially (Balance Sheet Logic)
In accrual accounting, the billing position shows up as an asset or a liability:

- **Underbilling** often becomes an **asset** (you are “owed” for work performed).
- **Overbilling** often becomes a **liability** (you have billed ahead; you “owe” performance).

Exact account names vary (e.g., *Costs and Estimated Earnings in Excess of Billings* vs. *Billings in Excess of Costs and Estimated Earnings*), but the logic is consistent.

## 4. Why This Matters (Operational Reality)
### Underbilling consumes working capital
If you’re underbilled, you are funding payroll, materials, and subs before collecting.

### Overbilling can finance the job (or hide a problem)
Overbilling can be healthy when it reflects contract terms (mobilization, stored materials, front-loaded schedules). It becomes dangerous when it exists because progress is overstated or the job is delayed.

## 5. Healthy vs. Dangerous Patterns
### Overbilling can be healthy when:
- It is aligned with the contract (deposit, milestone billing).
- It trends down as the job catches up (progress “earns” the billings).
- Customer relationship and documentation are strong (low dispute risk).

### Overbilling is dangerous when:
- It grows while field progress slows.
- It depends on “future productivity” to justify current revenue.
- It creates complacency (“cash is fine, so the job is fine”).

### Underbilling can be acceptable when:
- It is small, temporary, and explained by billing cycle timing.
- There is a clear path to bill within the next cycle.

### Underbilling is dangerous when:
- It persists month after month.
- It is driven by weak billing discipline (missing COs, late AIA, poor backup).
- It concentrates on a few large jobs (single-customer cash risk).

## 6. CFO Actions: What to Do with Each
### If underbilling is the issue
- Tighten billing cadence (weekly progress capture, not monthly scramble).
- Convert pending change orders into billable items (documentation discipline).
- Fix job cost coding and cost lag (your percent complete is only as good as costs).
- Escalate disputes early (don’t let “paperwork” become a cash crisis).

### If overbilling is the issue
- Stress-test the schedule and remaining cost (is the job actually earning it?).
- Watch retention exposure (overbilling can be reversed later via retention/closeout delays).
- Ensure you can defend the billing (backup, photos, inspections).

## 7. Strategic Insight
Billing position is not just accounting—it is your cash strategy inside each job.

**CFO Rule:** A healthy company is not one that is always overbilled. It is one that can explain *why* it is over/underbilled and can predict how that position will unwind over the next few billing cycles.
