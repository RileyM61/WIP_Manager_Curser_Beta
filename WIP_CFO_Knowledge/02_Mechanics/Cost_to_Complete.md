# Cost to Complete (CTC): The Most Important Estimate You Own

If WIP is an early warning system, **Cost to Complete (CTC)** is the sensor. It is the estimate that determines whether your reported profit is honest or a mirage.

## 1. Core Definition
**Cost to Complete (CTC)** is the estimated remaining direct cost required to finish a job from “today” to 100% completion.

- **CTC is not** “what’s left in the budget.”
- **CTC is** “what we realistically believe it will take to finish from here, given what we now know.”

## 2. Where CTC Fits in the WIP Engine
CTC drives the denominator of percent complete.

### Relationship
- **Estimated Total Cost** = Costs to Date + CTC
- **Percent Complete** = Costs to Date ÷ Estimated Total Cost

**Impact:** If CTC is understated, Estimated Total Cost is understated, percent complete rises, and you “recognize” profit too early.

## 3. What CTC Should Include (and Not Include)
CTC is typically direct job costs:
- **Labor** (field labor burdened appropriately)
- **Material**
- **Other direct costs** (subs, equipment, permits, rentals, etc.)

CTC typically should **not** include:
- Corporate overhead (unless your model is built to allocate it consistently)
- Future revenue items (CTC is a cost estimate, not a billing plan)

## 4. How to Build a Credible CTC
Credible CTC is built from scope remaining + productivity reality, not from “feelings.”

### Practical approach
1. **Confirm scope remaining**
   - What is not installed/complete yet?
   - Which change orders are approved, pending, or likely?
2. **Estimate remaining quantities**
   - Hours, units, linear feet, deliverables—whatever fits the job.
3. **Apply realistic production**
   - Use current productivity, not bid productivity.
4. **Include known risks explicitly**
   - Rework, access constraints, schedule compression, long-lead delays.

## 5. Updating CTC: Cadence and Discipline
WIP fails when CTC becomes stale.

- **Minimum cadence:** weekly for active jobs (biweekly at worst).
- **Update triggers:** any material event should force a reforecast:
  - major scope change
  - productivity shift
  - subcontractor change
  - material price movement
  - schedule acceleration/slowdown

**CFO Rule:** The job doesn’t “get better later” unless you have a plan that changes the cost curve.

## 6. What “Good” Looks Like (Patterns)
CTC should usually **decrease over time** as work is completed. It may spike when new information arrives, but that spike is information—not failure.

Healthy pattern indicators:
- CTC updates are small and frequent, not rare and dramatic.
- Changes are explainable (CO, scope discovery, productivity).
- Percent complete aligns with physical progress.

## 7. Common Failure Modes
- **Budget anchoring:** “We have $X left in budget” becomes the estimate.
- **Scope blindness:** change orders and rework are excluded.
- **Lagging costs:** costs-to-date are incomplete, masking the true run rate.
- **Single-point optimism:** “We’ll make it up at the end” without a plan.

## 8. CFO Questions That Stress-Test CTC
Ask these until the estimate breaks or becomes real:
- *What work remains that isn’t obvious?*
- *What would have to go right for this estimate to hold?*
- *What has gone wrong so far—and why would it stop now?*
- *If we had to finish with a new team, what would it cost?*

## 9. Strategic Insight
The purpose of CTC is not to “look good.” It is to buy time.

- **Honest CTC today** creates options (reprice, re-scope, renegotiate, add supervision).
- **Optimistic CTC** creates surprise write-downs when you have no time left to respond.
