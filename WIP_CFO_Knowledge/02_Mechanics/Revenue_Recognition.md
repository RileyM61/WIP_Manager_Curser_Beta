# Revenue Recognition: Turning Progress into Financial Truth

In long-duration construction jobs, you cannot wait until the last day to know whether you made money. **Revenue recognition** is the process of recording revenue and gross profit as work is performed, using WIP (percent complete) as the measurement system.

## 1. Core Concept
**Revenue Recognition** answers one question:

> *How much revenue have we actually earned as of a specific date?*

In WIP, the common approach is **Percent Complete (Cost-to-Cost)**.

## 2. The WIP Recognition Model (High Level)
### Step 1: Determine Percent Complete
$$ \text{Percent Complete} = \frac{\text{Costs to Date}}{\text{Estimated Total Cost}} $$

### Step 2: Compute Earned Revenue
$$ \text{Earned Revenue} = \text{Contract Value} \times \text{Percent Complete} $$

### Step 3: Compute Gross Profit to Date
$$ \text{Gross Profit to Date} = \text{Earned Revenue} - \text{Costs to Date} $$

### Step 4: Compare to Billings
Earned Revenue vs. Billings creates the **over/underbilling** position (balance sheet impact).

## 3. What Revenue Recognition Is (and Isn’t)
- **It is** an accrual-based measurement of economic activity.
- **It is not** cash received.
- **It is not** the invoice total.
- **It is not** “how the PM feels about the job.”

## 4. Why It Matters
Revenue recognition impacts:
- **Income statement timing** (when revenue and profit appear)
- **Balance sheet health** (over/underbilling assets/liabilities)
- **Bank covenants and bonding** (working capital and equity perception)
- **Decision-making** (whether leadership intervenes early or late)

## 5. The Two Ways It Breaks
Most revenue recognition issues come from bad inputs—not bad formulas.

### A) Bad cost data (numerator problem)
- costs posted late
- subs not accrued
- mis-coded costs (wrong job)

Result: Percent complete is wrong even if the estimate is perfect.

### B) Bad CTC (denominator problem)
- CTC is stale
- CTC is optimistic
- change orders and rework not included

Result: Earned revenue and profit are “pulled forward,” hiding the real outcome until the end.

## 6. CFO Rules for Reliable Recognition
- **Rule 1:** Update CTC as a management forecast, not as a budget compliance exercise.
- **Rule 2:** Book costs consistently and on time (accrue what hasn’t hit yet).
- **Rule 3:** Tie contract value to reality (approved COs in, unapproved COs treated cautiously).
- **Rule 4:** Never accept “the percent is right” if the CTC story isn’t defensible.

## 7. Practical Interpretation (What You’re Really Looking At)
Revenue recognition is the scoreboard.

- If earned revenue rises but cash does not, collections or billing timing are the issue.
- If cash is strong but earned revenue quality is weak (optimistic CTC), you are living on borrowed time.

**Strategic Insight:** WIP-based revenue recognition is not about making financial statements pretty. It is about seeing the job’s trajectory while you still have leverage to change it.
