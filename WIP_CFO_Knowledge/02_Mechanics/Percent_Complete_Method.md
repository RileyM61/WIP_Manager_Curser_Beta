# Percent Complete: The Engine of WIP

Percent Complete is the single most important input in a construction WIP schedule. It drives every downstream calculation, from revenue recognition to reported profit.

## 1. Core Definition
**Percent Complete** is an estimate of how much of a job’s total scope has been completed at a specific point in time. It determines how much revenue and profit (or loss) should be recognized for work performed to date.

## 2. Calculation Methodology
The most common industry standard is the **Cost-to-Cost** method.

### Formula
$$ \text{Percent Complete} = \frac{\text{Costs Incurred to Date}}{\text{Estimated Total Cost}} $$

*   **Costs Incurred:** Actual labor, materials, and direct costs booked to the job.
*   **Estimated Total Cost:** The sum of Costs Incurred + Estimated Cost to Complete (CTC).

## 3. Why It Drives Everything
Once established, this percentage dictates the financial reality of the project in the books:
*   **Revenue Recognized:** (Total Contract Value × % Complete)
*   **Gross Profit:** (Revenue Recognized - Costs Incurred)
*   **Billing Position:** Comparison of Revenue Recognized vs. Actual Billings (Over/Underbilling).

**Impact:** A small change in Percent Complete can materially alter reported earnings and balance sheet strength.

## 4. The Danger Zone
Percent Complete feels precise (mathematical), but it is built on **assumptions**.
*   **Optimism Bias:** Project teams often assume productivity will improve "later," underestimating remaining costs.
*   **Outdated Estimates:** Failing to update the Cost to Complete (CTC) creates a false denominator.
*   **Lagging Costs:** If costs haven't been posted (e.g., missing sub invoices), the numerator is too low, artificially lowering % complete.
*   **Premature Profit:** Overstating % complete pulls revenue and profit forward, hiding problems until they are irreversible.

## 5. Discipline: It Is Not a Guess
A disciplined Percent Complete is a **management estimate**, not a gut feeling. It requires rigorous questioning:
*   *What work actually remains?*
*   *Are remaining costs likely to follow the original plan?*
*   *Have change orders been incorporated?*
*   *Have productivity shifts been factored in?*

## 6. Strategic Insight
The goal of Percent Complete is **usefulness**, not appearance.
*   **Honest Updates:** Create early warnings for margin drift.
*   **Casual Estimates:** Create false confidence and surprise write-downs.

**CFO Rule:** Accurate estimates may be uncomfortable today, but they buy the time needed to fix problems before the job finishes.
