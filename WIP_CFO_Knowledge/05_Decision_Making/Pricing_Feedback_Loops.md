# Pricing Feedback Loops: Turning WIP into Better Bids

WIP is not just a job-tracking tool. It is a pricing intelligence system. If you consistently lose margin the same way, you are not “unlucky”—you are mispricing risk or misunderstanding production.

## 1. The Core Idea
Every job finishes with a gap between:
- **Estimate assumptions** (how you thought it would go)
- **Execution reality** (how it actually went)

That gap is where better pricing comes from—if you capture it and feed it back.

## 2. What WIP Reveals About Pricing (While You Still Have Memory)
Waiting for closeout is too late. WIP reveals patterns during the job:
- productivity assumptions (labor hours per unit)
- buyout vs estimate (subs, material)
- schedule impacts (stacking, overtime, access)
- change order capture effectiveness

## 3. The 5 Pricing Drivers to Track from WIP
### A) Labor productivity
- Where are hours overrunning? Which phase?
- Is it crew mix, supervision, rework, access, or sequencing?

### B) Buyout performance
- Are subs coming in above estimate consistently?
- Are allowances too low or scope definitions too loose?

### C) General conditions and schedule risk
- Are projects stretching longer than planned?
- Are you pricing the cost of time (supervision, rentals, temp facilities)?

### D) Scope clarity and change order recovery
- Are you performing extras without pricing leverage?
- Are contracts structured to support recovery (documentation, notice clauses)?

### E) Customer / project type patterns
- Do certain customers, delivery methods, or project types consistently drift margin?

## 4. The Loop (Simple Process That Works)
1. **Identify drift early** in WIP (margin trend, CTC deltas).
2. **Name the driver** (one sentence, not a story).
3. **Quantify it** (hours, dollars, days).
4. **Classify it**:
   - estimating miss (assumption wrong)
   - execution miss (process/field issue)
   - contract miss (terms and recovery)
5. **Update estimating standards**:
   - production rates
   - risk allowances/contingency
   - scope inclusions/exclusions
   - subcontractor strategy

## 5. The CFO Role: Protect the Feedback Loop
Good pricing feedback loops require accountability:
- Estimating must receive real job data (not filtered stories).
- Operations must own execution misses (not call everything “estimate error”).
- Leadership must use the data (or people stop providing it).

## 6. CFO Rule
If your WIP catches the same surprise repeatedly, it isn’t a surprise.

**CFO Rule:** The goal is not perfect estimating. The goal is systematically fewer unpriced risks and systematically faster detection of the ones that slip through.
