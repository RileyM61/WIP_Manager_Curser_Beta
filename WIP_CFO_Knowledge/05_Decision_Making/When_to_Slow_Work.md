# When to Slow Work: The Hard Decision That Protects Margin and Cash

Slowing work is not a default move. It’s a strategic lever used when continuing at full speed increases risk faster than it creates value.

## 1. The Core Question
You slow work when the job is consuming resources and creating exposure that you cannot control.

Ask:
> *If we keep going at this pace for 30 days, are we more likely to get paid and finish profitably—or more likely to create unbilled work, disputes, and rework?*

## 2. WIP-Based Triggers to Consider Slowing
### Trigger A: Underbilling is growing and you can’t bill it
If earned revenue is rising but billings can’t keep up (missing approvals, disputed SOV, missing backup), you are funding the customer’s project.

### Trigger B: Change order work is being performed without leverage
If significant scope is extra and recovery is uncertain, speed can destroy your negotiating position.

### Trigger C: Margin is collapsing and the driver is uncontrolled
If margin drift is driven by structural issues (misprice, impossible site conditions, owner-caused delays) and you have no corrective plan, pushing volume may only accelerate loss.

### Trigger D: Payment risk increases
If AR is aging, payment commitments are broken, or disputes are multiplying, continuing full speed increases your unsecured exposure.

## 3. What “Slow Work” Actually Means (Practical Options)
Slowing work is not necessarily “walk off the job.” Options include:
- **Pause extra work** until COs are approved.
- **Throttle non-critical scope** while closeout/billing catches up.
- **Re-sequence** to focus on billable, approved work.
- **Reduce crew size** to match cash and control risk.
- **Hold materials** until payment/approvals are secured (contract-dependent).

## 4. How to Do It Without Causing a Bigger Problem
Slowing must be controlled and documented.

Checklist:
- Confirm contract terms and notice requirements.
- Document the cause (approvals, disputes, payment status).
- Communicate clearly: what continues, what pauses, what unlocks resumption.
- Protect schedule claims with daily logs and correspondence.

## 5. What Not to Do
- Don’t slow work as punishment.
- Don’t slow work without a plan to restart.
- Don’t slow work without aligning leadership, PM, and contract strategy.

## 6. CFO Rule
Speed is not a strategy. Cash and leverage are strategies.

**CFO Rule:** If you can’t bill it, can’t collect it, or can’t defend it, you should not accelerate it.
