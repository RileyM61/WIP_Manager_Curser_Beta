# When to Push Collections: Protecting Cash Before It Becomes a Crisis

Collections is not an accounting task. It is a leadership task. In construction, you can do great work and still fail if you can’t convert earned revenue into cash.

## 1. The Core Principle
You push collections when:
- the customer is signaling delay,
- the invoice is becoming disputed,
- or your working capital cannot afford “normal” slowness.

WIP helps you decide *which* jobs matter most right now.

## 2. The WIP-Based Triggers to Escalate
### Trigger A: Underbilling + slow payment = compounding cash strain
If a job is underbilled and the customer is paying slowly, you are funding both the work and the delay.

### Trigger B: Billing position is unwinding in the wrong direction
- Underbilling grows each update, or
- Overbilling is at risk of reversal due to schedule slip

### Trigger C: Margin drift starts
When margin drifts down, you are less likely to “earn your way out.” Cash becomes more important because the job’s profit cushion is shrinking.

### Trigger D: Retention exposure is high and closeout is weak
If you don’t manage closeout aggressively, retention becomes “invisible AR.”

## 3. Collections vs. Disputes: Two Different Problems
You can’t “collect harder” on a disputed invoice without fixing the dispute.

Separate the work:
- **Collections execution**: reminders, confirmations, payment scheduling, escalation
- **Dispute resolution**: backup, approvals, sign-offs, compliance with contract notice terms

## 4. Practical Escalation Ladder (What to Do)
1. **Confirm the basics** (invoice received, correct email, correct backup).
2. **Get a commit date** (not “soon”—a date).
3. **Escalate scope clarity** (what is holding payment? who approves?)
4. **Resolve disputes with evidence** (photos, daily logs, signed T&M, inspector sign-off).
5. **Leadership-to-leadership call** for chronic issues.

## 5. What Not to Do
- Don’t wait for month-end to notice AR is a problem.
- Don’t let PMs “own collections” without support—PMs get busy and payment becomes optional.
- Don’t accept “they always pay late” as a strategy.

## 6. CFO Rule
Collections is not about being aggressive. It’s about being clear.

**CFO Rule:** If you can’t state why an invoice won’t be paid (or when it will), you don’t have an AR problem—you have an information problem. Fix the information, then fix the cash.
