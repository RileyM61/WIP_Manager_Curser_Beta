# Common Mistake: Treating WIP as Accounting

WIP touches accounting, but it is not “an accounting report.” WIP is a **management forecast**. When it’s treated as a compliance document, it becomes inaccurate, late, and useless.

## 1. What This Mistake Looks Like
- WIP is prepared only for month-end close or the bank.
- PMs “hand numbers to accounting” without owning the forecast.
- WIP is reviewed for formatting, not for truth.
- Teams optimize for “no surprises” instead of “early warnings.”

## 2. Why It Happens
- WIP contains formulas and balance sheet accounts, so it feels like accounting.
- The update process is painful, so people delay it.
- Leadership uses WIP to judge people, so people manage the optics.

## 3. What WIP Actually Is
WIP is a bridge between:
- **Operations** (what work remains, what productivity looks like)
- **Finance** (what revenue is earned, what cash risk exists)

It is a forecast model that answers:
- *What will this job cost to finish?*
- *What margin are we trending toward?*
- *Are we funding the job or is the customer funding us?*

## 4. The Damage This Mistake Causes
When WIP is treated as accounting:
- forecasts become stale
- losses are recognized late
- cash issues look “mysterious”
- leadership reacts after leverage is gone

The outcome is predictable: month-end surprises and “why didn’t we see this?”

## 5. How to Fix It (Make It a Weekly Operating System)
### A) Weekly WIP updates for active jobs
Short, consistent cadence beats monthly heroics.

### B) PMs own forecasts, finance owns standards
- PM: remaining scope, production reality, risks, CO status  
- Finance: cost completeness, consistency, reporting discipline

### C) Review WIP like you review a job
Ask:
- *What changed since last week?*
- *What’s the cash impact in the next 30–60 days?*
- *What action are we taking?*

## 6. CFO Rule
Accounting records the past. WIP protects the future.

**CFO Rule:** If your WIP doesn’t change what you do next week, it’s not management information—it’s paperwork.
