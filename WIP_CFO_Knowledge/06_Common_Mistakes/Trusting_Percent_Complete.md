# Common Mistake: Trusting Percent Complete

Percent complete looks precise because it is a formula. But the formula is only as good as the inputs. When teams treat percent complete as “truth,” they often **lock in false confidence** and delay the moment of correction.

## 1. What This Mistake Looks Like
- “The percent is right” becomes the end of the discussion.
- Percent complete is advanced to hit billing or margin targets.
- Percent complete changes without a defensible CTC update.
- Field reality doesn’t match the reported percent.

## 2. Why It Happens
- Percent complete feels objective (math).
- Teams want stability and predictability in reporting.
- There is pressure to avoid bad news.
- CTC updates are uncomfortable, so percent is used as a shortcut.

## 3. The Underlying Truth
In cost-to-cost WIP:

$$ \text{Percent Complete} = \frac{\text{Costs to Date}}{\text{Estimated Total Cost}} $$

Percent complete is not “measured.” It is **derived** from:
- cost completeness (numerator integrity)
- CTC realism (denominator integrity)

## 4. The Damage This Mistake Causes
### A) Premature profit
Overstated percent complete pulls revenue and profit forward.

### B) Late loss recognition
Losses “appear” late, when the remaining work can no longer be re-priced or re-sequenced.

### C) Cash misreads
Over/underbilling positions become distorted, leading to bad billing and collections priorities.

## 5. How to Fix It (Validation Discipline)
### A) Treat percent complete as an output, not an input
You update cost completeness and CTC; percent complete follows.

### B) Reconcile to physical progress
If a third-party walked the site, would they agree?

### C) Require the CTC story
If percent moved, what changed in remaining work, production, or risk?

### D) Watch for lagging costs
If subs aren’t accrued, percent complete may be understated today and then spike later.

## 6. CFO Rule
Percent complete is not the goal. Accurate decisions are the goal.

**CFO Rule:** Never accept a percent complete you can’t defend with remaining work, realistic production, and a credible CTC.
