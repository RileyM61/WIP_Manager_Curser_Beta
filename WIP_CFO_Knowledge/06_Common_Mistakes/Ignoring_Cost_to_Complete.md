# Common Mistake: Ignoring Cost to Complete (CTC)

If you want one reason why WIP schedules lie, this is it: **CTC is missing, stale, or treated like a “budget remainder” instead of a real forecast.**

## 1. What This Mistake Looks Like
- CTC is not updated until month-end (or quarter-end).
- CTC is “last month’s number” with minor tweaks.
- CTC equals “budget remaining” regardless of productivity.
- The team can’t explain why CTC changed (or didn’t).

## 2. Why It Happens
- Updating CTC feels like admitting the job is worse than planned.
- Teams confuse “estimate” with “commitment” (fear of being wrong).
- There is no weekly cadence, so the update becomes a painful event.
- Cost data is incomplete, so people don’t trust the model.

## 3. The Damage It Causes (Mechanically)
Ignoring CTC breaks the denominator of percent complete:

- Estimated Total Cost = Costs to Date + CTC  
- Percent Complete = Costs to Date ÷ Estimated Total Cost

If CTC is understated:
- Estimated Total Cost is understated
- Percent Complete is overstated
- Revenue and profit are pulled forward
- Losses appear late (when there’s no time to fix them)

## 4. The “False Comfort” Trap
This mistake often looks like stability:
- margin “holds”
- percent complete “moves”
- leadership feels calm

Then a late correction hits and the job “suddenly” loses money. It wasn’t sudden—your CTC was just stale.

## 5. How to Fix It (Process, Not Motivation)
### A) Set a weekly cadence
CTC must be updated weekly for active jobs. Small updates prevent big surprises.

### B) Tie CTC to remaining work
Even a simple remaining-scope estimate beats “budget remaining.”

### C) Require a one-sentence driver
Every material CTC change should be explainable:
- *“Buyout came in $18k high.”*
- *“Rework added 120 labor hours.”*
- *“Schedule compression is driving overtime.”*

### D) Reduce cost lag
Accrue missing subs and post costs timely. You can’t forecast on incomplete history.

## 6. CFO Rule
CTC is not a number you update to look good. It is a number you update to stay alive.

**CFO Rule:** If CTC hasn’t been updated, your WIP is not a forecast—it’s a story.
