# Healthy WIP Patterns: What “Good” Looks Like Before the Job Finishes

A healthy WIP schedule isn’t one with perfect numbers. It’s one with **coherent patterns**—numbers that tell a consistent story between operations, billing, and cost reality.

## 1. The CFO Lens: Consistency Beats Optimism
Healthy WIP is defined by:
- **Frequent, explainable updates**
- **Small corrections**, not quarterly surprises
- **Alignment** between field progress, costs, and billing cadence

## 2. Healthy Pattern #1: CTC Moves Like a Forecast
**Cost to Complete (CTC)** should generally trend downward as the job progresses. It can spike when you learn something new, but the spike should have a reason.

Healthy signs:
- CTC changes are tied to scope, production, or schedule events.
- You can explain the delta in one sentence.
- The team updates CTC before month-end, not after.

Red flag pattern:
- CTC is flat for months, then jumps late (stale estimate).

## 3. Healthy Pattern #2: Percent Complete Matches Physical Reality
Percent complete should roughly match what a third-party would observe on site.

Healthy signs:
- % complete increases steadily.
- Field leadership agrees with the percent and can defend it with remaining work.

Red flag pattern:
- % complete jumps without corresponding installed work (often a denominator problem: optimistic CTC).

## 4. Healthy Pattern #3: Billing Position Is Explainable
Billing position (over/underbilling) should not be a mystery.

Healthy signs:
- Underbilling is small and clears within a billing cycle.
- Overbilling exists for contract reasons (mobilization, stored materials) and unwinds as the job progresses.
- The team can explain **why** the job is over/underbilled and **when** it will reverse.

Red flag pattern:
- Chronic underbilling that grows (working capital drain).
- Chronic overbilling that grows while production slows (future reversal risk).

## 5. Healthy Pattern #4: Contract Value Changes Are Controlled
Healthy WIP separates “approved” from “hope.”

Healthy signs:
- Approved change orders are incorporated consistently.
- Pending/at-risk change orders are tracked but treated cautiously in contract value.
- Revenue recognition doesn’t depend on unapproved paperwork.

Red flag pattern:
- Contract value jumps late with “catch-up” COs after costs have already blown past budget.

## 6. Healthy Pattern #5: Margin Is Stable (or Moves for Known Reasons)
Margin drift happens. Healthy organizations detect it early and can explain it.

Healthy signs:
- Margin changes are tied to identifiable drivers (production, scope, buyout, schedule).
- Losses are recognized early (not hidden until closeout).

Red flag pattern:
- “The job is fine” while margin erodes every update.

## 7. Healthy Pattern #6: Costs Post Timely (Low Cost Lag)
Your percent complete is only as good as your costs-to-date.

Healthy signs:
- Sub invoices are accrued when work is performed.
- Payroll and materials are coded correctly and consistently.
- The schedule is reviewed with a clear “costs missing?” checklist.

Red flag pattern:
- Big cost dumps after month-end that rewrite history.

## 8. CFO Summary: A Healthy WIP Tells One Story
A healthy WIP schedule aligns:
- **Field reality** (what’s actually done)
- **Cost reality** (what has actually been incurred)
- **Billing reality** (what has actually been invoiced)

**CFO Rule:** When those three realities diverge, your job isn’t “bad.” Your information is incomplete—and incomplete information is how bad jobs survive unnoticed.
