# Warning Signs: The Patterns That Precede a Bad Job

WIP doesn’t predict the future perfectly. It does something more valuable: it shows **repeatable patterns** that almost always precede margin loss and cash pain.

## 1. Category A: Estimate Integrity Red Flags
- **CTC hasn’t changed in weeks/months** on an active job.
- **Percent complete rises, but field progress hasn’t** (denominator optimism).
- **“We’ll make it up later”** is the only explanation for why the forecast holds.
- **Change orders are performed but not priced/approved** and contract value is treated as if approval is guaranteed.

## 2. Category B: Cost Data Red Flags
- **Big cost dumps after period close** (your WIP is always late).
- **Sub costs are missing** (no accrual discipline).
- **Cost coding is inconsistent** (costs land in the wrong job/cost type).
- **Costs-to-date lag reality** (numerator understatement makes % complete look “better”).

## 3. Category C: Billing & Cash Red Flags
- **Underbilling grows every update** (working capital drain).
- **Overbilling grows while schedule slips** (future reversal risk).
- **Collections lag is normalized** (“they always pay late”).
- **Retention exposure is high** with weak closeout processes.

## 4. Category D: Margin Drift Red Flags
- **Margin declines in consecutive updates** without corrective actions.
- **Margin volatility** (big swings) indicating weak forecast discipline.
- **Forecast profit depends on unapproved CO recovery**.
- **Late recognition of loss** (losses appear at the end rather than gradually).

## 5. Category E: Operational Red Flags (WIP shows it indirectly)
- **Schedule compression** → overtime, stacking trades, rework.
- **High rework / punch list growth** → “invisible” labor burn.
- **Buyout misses** → subs/material locked in above estimate.
- **Crew churn / supervision overload** → productivity erosion.

## 6. What To Do When You See a Warning Sign
WIP warning signs are not “gotchas.” They are prompts to run a quick, structured review.

### CFO quick triage
1. **Confirm cost completeness** (what hasn’t hit yet?)
2. **Update CTC honestly** (what will it take to finish from today?)
3. **Validate contract value** (approved vs pending vs disputed)
4. **Assess billing position** (how is this affecting cash in the next 30–60 days?)
5. **Agree on an action** (who does what by when)

## 7. CFO Rule
The most dangerous jobs are not the ones showing a loss today.  
They are the ones showing **profit on paper** that depends on assumptions no one can defend.
