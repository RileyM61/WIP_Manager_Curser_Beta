# Margin Drift: The Slow Leak That Becomes a Write-Down

Most job failures don’t happen in one dramatic event. They happen through **margin drift**—small, repeated forecast degradations that are tolerated until they become irreversible.

## 1. Core Definition
**Margin Drift** is the downward movement of a job’s forecasted gross margin over time.

It shows up when:
- Estimated Total Cost increases (CTC rises),
- or Contract Value fails to keep pace with scope (unpriced change, rework),
- or both.

## 2. Why It Matters
Margin drift is the difference between:
- **A fixable problem** (early) and
- **A forced acceptance** (late).

When you see it early, you still have levers: scope, staffing, schedule, procurement, change order recovery, billing discipline.

## 3. The Most Common Drivers
### A) Productivity erosion
- labor hours per unit worsen
- supervision bandwidth is thin
- rework consumes “invisible” hours

### B) Scope growth without price recovery
- change orders performed but not approved
- “small extras” that compound

### C) Buyout misses / vendor escalation
- subs come in higher than estimate
- material prices rise beyond allowances

### D) Schedule compression / delays
- overtime, stacking trades, inefficiency
- extended general conditions

### E) Bad data (fake drift or hidden drift)
- late costs (drift appears suddenly)
- mis-coded costs (drift appears in the wrong job)

## 4. How to Detect Margin Drift in WIP
Look for:
- **CTC increases in consecutive updates**
- **% complete increases but margin falls**
- **“Flat margin” stories with no supporting evidence** (often stale CTC)
- **Margin volatility** (big swings) indicating weak forecasting discipline

## 5. The CFO Response: Diagnose Before You “Fix”
Margin drift should trigger a short, structured review:
- **What changed in scope?** (approved vs pending vs performed)
- **What changed in production?** (hours, crew mix, learning curve)
- **What changed in procurement?** (subs, material, rentals)
- **What changed in schedule?** (sequence, access, dependencies)

Then you decide: is this **recoverable drift** or **structural drift**?

## 6. Recoverable vs. Structural Drift
### Recoverable drift
You have a clear plan that changes the cost curve:
- re-sequence work
- add supervision
- improve prep / reduce rework
- lock pricing / renegotiate subs
- formalize and collect change orders

### Structural drift
The job was mispriced or conditions fundamentally changed:
- scope is larger than priced
- production assumption is wrong
- contract terms cap recovery

Structural drift requires fast acceptance and action:
- adjust forecast now (don’t delay)
- protect cash (billing + collections)
- prevent repeat (estimating feedback loop)

## 7. CFO Rule
**A job is not “healthy” because it is still profitable.**  
It is healthy when the forecast is stable and defensible.

Margin drift is a signal. The only unacceptable response is ignoring it until the closeout forces the truth.
