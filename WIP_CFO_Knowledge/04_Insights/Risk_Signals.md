# Risk Signals: What WIP Tells You About the Next Problem

Risk in construction is rarely hidden. It is usually visible in the WIP—if you know which signals matter and which “normal noise” to ignore.

## 1. Risk Is a Pattern, Not a Point-in-Time Number
One bad week doesn’t make a job risky. A repeated pattern does.

In WIP, risk shows up as:
- repeated CTC increases
- persistent billing misalignment
- forecast explanations that rely on hope
- increasing uncertainty in scope and schedule

## 2. Signal Category A: Estimate Credibility Risk
These signals suggest the forecast is not defensible:
- CTC is unchanged for long stretches on an active job.
- % complete advances while costs-to-date stay oddly low (missing costs).
- The forecast assumes productivity improves without a plan.
- Pending COs are treated as guaranteed contract value.

## 3. Signal Category B: Margin Loss Risk
These signals suggest the job is heading toward a write-down:
- margin declines in consecutive updates
- buyout is materially above estimate
- rework/punch grows faster than completion
- schedule compression requires overtime or trade stacking

## 4. Signal Category C: Cash Stress Risk
These signals predict near-term cash pain:
- underbilling grows (working capital drain)
- overbilling grows while schedule slips (reversal risk)
- retention exposure is high with weak closeout execution
- AR aging on key customers trends worse

## 5. Signal Category D: Concentration Risk
Sometimes the “job risk” is actually “company risk.”
- a few jobs drive most of the backlog
- one customer drives most of the billings
- one PM/team carries the most volatile forecasts

Concentration amplifies errors: one wrong estimate becomes a company-wide cash event.

## 6. What to Do When Risk Signals Trigger
WIP should trigger a specific response, not vague concern.

### CFO risk response
1. **Validate cost completeness** (accrue missing subs, confirm coding)
2. **Re-forecast CTC** using remaining scope and current productivity
3. **Segment COs** (approved vs pending vs disputed) and adjust contract value discipline
4. **Create a cash plan** (billing cadence + collections escalation)
5. **Assign ownership** (one person owns the forecast, one owns CO recovery, one owns collections)

## 7. CFO Rule
Risk doesn’t become dangerous because it exists.  
It becomes dangerous because nobody owns it.

**CFO Rule:** If a WIP risk signal is real, you should be able to name the driver, the action, the owner, and the date it will be reassessed.
