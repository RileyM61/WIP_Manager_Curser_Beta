# Forecast Adjustments: Using WIP to Change the Outcome (Not Just Report It)

WIP is most valuable when it drives action. A forecast update is not an accounting exercise—it is a decision moment: **do we accept the trend, or do we intervene to change it?**

## 1. What a “Forecast Adjustment” Means
A forecast adjustment is any change to the inputs that drive the job’s projected outcome:
- **CTC (Cost to Complete)**
- **Contract Value** (approved scope, price recovery)
- **Production plan** (how you will perform remaining work)
- **Schedule assumptions** (sequence, access, constraints)

The best forecast adjustments are paired with a **plan**.

## 2. The CFO Standard: Forecast = Best Estimate, Not Best Case
Forecast should represent the most likely outcome given current facts.

Avoid:
- “We’ll get it back”
- “We’re just behind on posting costs”
- “We’ll close those COs later”

Prefer:
- quantified remaining work
- realistic production
- documented CO pipeline with probabilities

## 3. The Three Adjustments That Matter Most
### A) Adjust CTC when reality changes
Triggers:
- productivity shifts
- rework discovery
- buyout misses
- schedule compression

### B) Adjust Contract Value only when it’s real
Good practice:
- include approved COs consistently
- track pending COs separately (don’t treat hope as revenue)

### C) Adjust the plan (not just the spreadsheet)
If you change the forecast, you should be able to answer:
- *What will we do differently next week?*

## 4. Practical “Intervention Playbooks”
When you see margin drift or cash strain, typical interventions include:
- **Scope recovery:** formalize COs, tighten documentation, align SOV to field progress.
- **Production recovery:** re-sequence, improve prep, increase supervision, reduce rework loops.
- **Procurement recovery:** renegotiate, lock pricing, re-bid remaining scope.
- **Schedule recovery:** remove constraints, coordinate trades, avoid stacking inefficiency.
- **Billing recovery:** shorten billing cycle, bill stored materials properly, reduce underbilling.

## 5. The CFO Split: Accept vs. Fight
Forecast discipline means knowing when to stop “fighting” the forecast.

### Accept the forecast when:
- the driver is structural (misprice, fundamental scope change, contract constraints)
- you lack leverage to recover margin
- remaining work is too small to meaningfully change outcome

### Fight the forecast when:
- the driver is operational and controllable (sequence, supervision, rework)
- CO recovery is realistic and actively managed
- there is enough remaining scope to change the cost curve

## 6. How to Prevent Forecast Whiplash
Forecast whiplash (big up/down swings) is usually a process problem.

Reduce it by:
- weekly CTC updates (small changes)
- accruing missing costs (lower cost lag)
- separating approved vs pending CO value
- documenting the driver of each material forecast change

## 7. CFO Rule
Forecasting is not about being right. It is about being early.

**CFO Rule:** A forecast change without an operational change is just a confession that the job will end however it ends.
