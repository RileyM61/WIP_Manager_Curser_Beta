# Cash Flow Implications: How WIP Predicts “Broke or Not Broke”

WIP is not a cash report. But it is one of the best predictors of future cash stress because it exposes **who is funding the job right now**: you, the customer, or your vendors.

## 1. The Core Insight
Cash problems in construction are usually caused by one (or more) of these:
- **Underbilling** (you’re funding work performed)
- **Collections lag** (you billed, but you can’t convert to cash)
- **Margin drift** (you’re doing work that won’t produce the cash you think it will)
- **Cost lag** (you’re underestimating what you’ve already incurred)

WIP helps you see each one before the bank balance forces the lesson.

## 2. Underbilling = Working Capital Drain
When earned revenue is greater than billings, you have performed work that you haven’t billed for yet.

Cash implication:
- Payroll and subs get paid on time.
- Your invoices do not keep up.
- The gap must be funded by your line of credit or retained cash.

Practical sign:
- Underbilling grows on the same job in consecutive updates.

## 3. Overbilling = Temporary Cash Support (with Conditions)
Overbilling means the customer has paid (or been invoiced for) more than you’ve earned to date.

Cash implication:
- Overbilling can **finance the job** early.
- Overbilling can also become a **future reversal** if the job slows, disputes arise, or closeout drags.

Practical sign:
- Overbilling grows while schedule slips or production slows.

## 4. Collections Lag: The “Third Variable” WIP Doesn’t Solve Alone
WIP can show you billing position, but it cannot guarantee collections.

Cash implication:
- Even “healthy” billing position becomes meaningless if invoices age out.
- AR aging and dispute management must be viewed alongside WIP.

CFO check:
- If WIP shows underbilling *and* AR is stretched, cash pain is not a timing issue—it’s a system issue.

## 5. Retention: Hidden Cash Pressure
Retention is a predictable cash delay that often gets ignored until the end.

Cash implication:
- High retention exposure requires planning for the final 5–10% cash gap.
- Closeout discipline (punch, lien waivers, O&M, as-builts) is a cash strategy.

## 6. The Two Cash Traps WIP Reveals Early
### Trap A: “Profitable but broke”
Common causes:
- underbilling
- slow collections
- heavy retention

### Trap B: “Cash-rich but quietly losing money”
Common causes:
- overbilling
- optimistic CTC (profit pulled forward)

## 7. CFO Actions: Turning WIP into a Cash Plan
Use WIP to build a short-term cash plan by job:
- **Next 30 days:** What can we bill immediately? What’s missing (CO backup, photos, schedule-of-values)?
- **Next 60 days:** Which jobs will unwind overbilling/underbilling? How will that affect cash?
- **Next 90 days:** Which jobs are trending toward loss? What’s the cash exposure if the margin collapses?

## 8. CFO Rule
Cash flow is not a mystery. It is a math problem with behavior attached.

**CFO Rule:** If you want better cash, don’t start with the bank account. Start with WIP positions (over/underbilling), then fix billing discipline and collections execution.
