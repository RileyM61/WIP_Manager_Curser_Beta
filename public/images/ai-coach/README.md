## AI Coach avatar image

This repo expects the AI Coach avatar to be **provided locally** (it is not tracked in git to avoid committing binaries).

Place the approved AI Coach avatar image into this folder as:

- `public/images/ai-coach/coach.png`

Notes:
- Keep it as a **PNG**.
- Prefer a square crop (e.g., 512×512 or 1024×1024).
- Once the file is added, it can be referenced in UI as: `/images/ai-coach/coach.png`
